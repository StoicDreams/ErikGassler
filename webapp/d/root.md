### Who is Erik Gassler?

<webui-sideimage reverse src="https://cdn.myfi.ws/v/Vecteezy/developer-at-laptop-and-computer-with-open-robotic-soft.svg">
    <webui-page-segment elevation="10">
        A software engineer who is constantly striving to improve himself, his craft, and his peers by constantly seeking to improve knowledge, understandings, standards, and workflows to maximize the productivity and quality of output for himself and his team.

        Erik's peers frequently comment on his ability to think outside-the-box, as he is someone who believes in analyzing each problem for what it is and following scientific, data-driven principals to do the best that he can and get the best from his team, rather than following herd-mentality thinking with trendy and often detrimental "industry standard" tools and frameworks.

        Erik believes in speaking out against decisions and practices that hinder, erode, or otherwise degrade the product or efficiencies in building and maintaining software.

        Erik's peers have frequently shared being impressed with his abilities to debug issues, even from projects he's done no previous work in. As well as his ability to take over projects that other developers have spent months on, and finishing them within as little as a few days or weeks, even when it is deemed necessary to restart a project from scratch rather than continue from the previous work done.

    <webui-page-segment elevation="10">
        Erik has recognized a trend in modern companies to misunderstand what agile development is and use inferior frameworks such as Agile, Scrum, Sprints, and DevOps to produce products at a pace and quality that is exponentially worse than what is possible using true agile development and continuous delivery workflows.

        Recognizing this, Erik has made it his mission to share his knowledge and expertise with companies and teams to help them build and deliver products using agile development standards and continuous delivery workflows that will allow them to complete phases of projects in spans of hours to weeks versus the months to years they're currently spending. This mission hitting a major milestone in May of 2023 with the release of his first book [CASE: Continuous Agile Software Engineering](https://a.co/d/3da8fQc), available now on Amazon.
