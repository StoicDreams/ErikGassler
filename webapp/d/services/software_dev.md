Do you have a concept for a website, desktop application, or mobile app that you need built?

Do you want a development team that you won't have to wait years for a stable product to deliver to your customers?

Do you want a reliable product that you can start serving to your customers within as little as a month, with new features and updates added daily?

## Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Rust

<webui-sideimage reverse src="https://cdn.myfi.ws/v/Vecteezy/self-discipline-or-self-control-to-complete-work-or-achieve.svg">

To deliver the best products in the fastest development times I specialize in developing software and website products using Rust, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I specialize in deploying products through dedicated hosting services for those clients that prioritize fixed spending, faster applications, and aren't expecting daily user counts in the billions any time soon, if ever.

For those clients who have much bigger budgets and absolutely need rapid scalability for much larger user bases I also specialize in setting up and developing for Azure Cloud technologies.

I can also provide industry leading delivery times for products and features using my personally developed CASE methodologies and workflows which allow me to build and deliver top quality websites, desktop applications, and mobile apps within a typical 3 to 6 month development window (comparible to teams of 5-10 developers delivering over a 18 to 36+ month development window), with a customer usuable website or application typically delivered and useable within the first month.
