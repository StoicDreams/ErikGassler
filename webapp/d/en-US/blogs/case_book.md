Software engineering is changing rapidly, making it more important than ever to have a comprehensive framework for crafting better software. That's where CASE (Continuous Agile Software Engineering) comes in. This book provides an innovative approach to software development that can help teams work more efficiently, deliver high-quality products, and meet the demands of their customers.

CASE offers a comprehensive and fresh approach to software development that could be used to solve many of the issues companies and teams are facing today in delivering their ideas and products to their consumers. When compared to traditional frameworks such as Agile and Scrum, using CASE has been proven to dramatically reduce the time, effort, and cost needed to release new products and features to consumers, often by at least a factor of 10.

What this means in practice, is that instead of having a development team of 10 software engineers using Scrum and subsequently taking 12 months to develop and deliver a product with X number of features, using CASE this same product and features could potentially be delivered by a single software engineer in 3 to 6 months.

Let's presume the latter, 6 months, and run the numbers. Let's presume an average software engineer salary of $150k, and each software engineer takes 5 weeks of vacation each year, giving us 1,880 hours of work each year per software engineer. Using Scrum in this example scenario, it would take 18,800 work hours and cost the company $1.5 million to deliver. Using CASE on the other hand, it would take 940 work hours and cost the company $75k to deliver. That's a 20X difference in cost.

At its core, CASE is about simplifying all aspects of software development, meeting the demands for agility in developing software, and removing wasteful and detrimental practices from our workflows at all levels - individual, team, and organizational.

One example of CASE in action involves its Continuous Planning principles. Instead of trying to tackle all or several aspects of a project upfront, mapping out all of the problems to solve, and best-guessing the solutions to those problems that result in premature decisions being made with little to no educated knowledge, CASE guides you to focus only on the immediate needs while using that focus to properly research the problem at hand and develop the best solution. By focusing on small incremental steps, developers and teams can remove a lot of duplicated effort throughout the development process, while also helping to assure that solutions are decided on and developed based on facts and research instead of intuition and feelings.

By embracing true agility in software development, CASE also allows teams to embrace change as part of their process rather than fighting against it. Rather than sticking with rigid plans and processes, teams use CASE to continuously review feedback and their goals, make adjustments when needed, and collaborate on solutions that will get them closer to their desired outcome.

Applying CASE principles also helps reduce effort and time by asserting the prioritization of automating processes and tasks whenever possible, removing wasteful and often detrimental bureaucracy from decision-making, and empowering software engineers to fully utilize their strengths to do their work, giving them more fulfillment and satisfaction in their work.

Applying CASE principles leads to more productive software development. With Software Engineers being more productive and empowered in their work, they are often more energized, confident, motivated, and prideful in their work. This creates a cyclic effect that further boosts their productivity.

Finally, CASE emphasizes the importance of continuously delivering updates to your customers. By frequently releasing software improvements, teams can keep their customers happy and ensure their products are up-to-date with industry changes.

If you're looking to substantially improve your software development process, embrace a culture of innovation and empowerment, and deliver high-quality products faster, CASE is the framework for you.

With its principles of simplicity, agility, and continuous delivery, CASE can help organizations and teams craft better software solutions more efficiently than ever before.
