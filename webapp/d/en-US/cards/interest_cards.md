As of Sept 28th, 2022, I have made the decision to migrate my personal projects over to the Rust language, which are all previously in C#/Blazor tech stacks. Web UI is my first project down that path.

As of Oct 26th, 2022, I have successfully migrated about half of my website projects, including ErikGassler.com, to the Web UI framework.

Web UI is a Rust-based website framework that is designed to minimize boilerplate when setting up a project, while including a rich component system to help make building and maintaining Material UI standardized websites quick and easy.

I am absolutely in love with Rust at this point. Witin my first 2 weeks into learning Rust, I already felt more productive writing Rust code than writing code in C#, which I have been using full-time since early 2008.

Task Story is a tool I'm developing to provide an easy way to manage software development work through a framework of Problems, Solutions, and Tasks while enforcing productive standards that will enable software teams and developers to be more productive and build better experiences for their customers.

This project is very early in development - started building in August of 2022, but is ready for developers to start using, with more advanced features expected to be rolling out within the next few days.

My company that I started in 2008 and use for branding my personal projects with, which initially was for a game I developed and published on the Xbox 360 in December of that year.

The projects I am currently focused on for this company are open-source projects centered around providing tools and frameworks to help drive the software development industry forward with more productive tooling, workflows, standards, and practices.

Website dedicated to documenting my career developed Continuous Agile Software Engineering standards and practices that I have found to be in an estimated range of 10 to 100 times more productive for software development than the Agile/Scrum/DevOps/Sprint based frameworks I see commonly used today.

```card "Agile Manifesto Principles" "580" "success" "memo-circle-info duotone" "https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" "Agile Manifesto Principles"
When people ask me if I know and practice "Agile" development. That answer is a resounding yes. But this question is most frequently asked by those who don't understand what Agile development is.

In fact, I have been following many agile development principals since I first started programming, long before I ever heard the term or researched what it was. To me these principals are just logical, humble, and ethical behavior.

I came across this Programmers Oath from Robert C. Martin back in 2017. This oath affirmed many of my existing beliefs about programming, while adding some new ones I hadn't thought about.
