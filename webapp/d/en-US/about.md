### Erik Gassler is a professional software engineer with expertise in agile development and continuous delivery workflows

<webui-sideimage src="https://cdn.erikgassler.com/img/eg/me_256.png">

Erik Gassler began his software engineering career in April of 2007 when he purchased a book on developing websites using Apache servers, PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, and quit his full-time day job so he could focus 100% of his efforts on learning how to program and develop websites.

By the end of 2007, this website helped Erik land hist first professional role as the sole software engineer for a small startup called Opinions R Fun in Wichita, KS. In addition to the PHP stacked work that he was already familiar with, Erik also dove into some ActionScript/Flash programming, as well as learning SEO marketing which he used to bring up the site traffic for OpinionsRFun.com from about 10 visitors a month to over 100 per day.

Unfortunately, Erik's accomplishments within this role were not enough to save the company from bad management, and the company filed for bankruptcy and laid off all employees just 4 months after hiring Erik.

His next full-time role for the next few years would be as a CNC machinist, but he would continue working full-time on the side learning and developing his software engineering craft.

## The start of Stoic Dreams

In 2008, Erik switched his learning over to C# and .NET Framework development, refactoring his website to suit.

Around October of 2008, Erik shifted his focus to start working on a game project using Microsoft's XNA framework, which allowed nearly full featured game development for PC and Xbox 360 platforms while writing code in C#.

Erik then launched his first game titled Cosmos for the Xbox 360 in December of 2008. While the game was financially a failure, it was a huge success in teaching Erik various skills regarding performance tuning and object-oriented programming, which dramatically improved the quality of his website projects.

Over the next couple of years Erik would focus largely on experimenting with various game development projects, website projects, and desktop development to build productivity tools to aid him in his game and website development.

## Team Engineering at SoftRock

At the end of 2010, Erik moved to Florida where he then landed a software engineer position with a company known as SoftRock. Here Erik was able to prove his ability to learn new languages quickly as needed, as he had to learn SoftRock's primary languages JavaScript and Coldfusion.

Within his his first few months, Erik was able to impress the team by becoming proficient enough with Coldfusion that he was then teaching seasoned veterans within the team ways to improve performance in their code and access features they didn't know existed within the language. And within 2 years Erik had become a clear Coldfusion and JavaScript expert within the team, being the go-to person for solving complex problems, or just when someone needed some help, and writing many of the company's libraries and frameworks that would be used across it's many websites.

**Some of Erik's notable accomplishments while at SoftRock include:**

- Architected, built, and maintained a role-based security framework that would eventually be deployed to most of the company websites as well as carried over to GSC projects.
- Architected, built, and maintained an agent scripting platform that guided agents through a call script with speech to callers handled through pre-recorded segments instead of agents directly speaking with callers. This system allowed agents to handle up to 2 calls at once while also performing better per call than top agents who spoke directly to callers using the same script.
- Developed and maintained several developer projects including a security framework, validation libraries, and several scripting libraries and tools used throughout front-end and back-end development.

## Principal Engineering at General Services Corp

Eventually SoftRock closed its doors, and the owner recruited a handful of developers to help start his next company, General Services Corp. Here, Erik took on a much more principal level role, working directly with the owner to take direction on problems he wanted solved, and using his expertise to architect and build solutions to those problems.
This role played a huge part in Erik developing his expertise refining agile development and continuous delivery workflows. Incorporating standards and building tools that allowed him to push code updates confidently and safely to production multiple times per day.
Some of Erik's notable accomplishments while at General Services Corp include:

- Developed a browser extension for Chrome, Edge, and Safari that allowed users to save and autofill information while filling out job applications.
- Architected and built a reporting website called Joe Morning, launching with role-based security framework and first few reports within the first week of development.
- Integrated into Joe Morning several dev-tools such as error tracking and management for all company websites and services.
- Integrated into Joe Morning several content management features for managing specific page content for multiple company websites.
- Integrated hundreds of reports, each with 5-8 report specific filtering, column toggles to show/hide any column, and sorting for any column.
- Adhere to development standards targeting sub 100 millisecond responses for all browser to server transactions, with anything over 300 milliseconds being considered an urgent bug.
- Was the primary developer, contributing more than 95% of the code in Joe Morning, with all work noted above done within 18 months.

After leaving General Services Corp, Erik and his wife moved to Washington state where he soon landed a contract role with Microsoft. At Microsoft, Erik started diving into the worlds of Scrum, DevOps, Azure Cloud technologies, and React with TypeScript development for UI work. As well as now getting to use C# technologies in a professional capacity on enterprise grade products.
After 8 months Erik successfully transitioned to full-time employment at Microsoft.
During his time there, Erik worked on a small number of teams and projects including both UI focused and backend focused projects.
Some of Erik's notable accomplishments while at Microsoft include:

- Learning Azure Cloud services, DevOps pipelines, React/TypeScript programming, while architecting, building, and launching a greenfield project within his first 3 months as a contractor.
- Hosting a handful of training workshops to help spread knowledge about unit testing and test-driven development.
- Mentored a new software engineer fresh out of college, who following Erik's mentorship took over as lead developer for the UI work on the team, allowing Erik to them transition to take over development on a backend project.
- Erik re-architected and rebuilt a report processing solution to solve performance issues, bringing customer facing query processing times from spans of double-digit seconds to triple-digit minutes, down to spans of milliseconds to single-digit seconds.
