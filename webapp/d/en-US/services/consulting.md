Does your current development practices involve tools and practices such as Scrum, DevOps, or Sprints?

If so, then you may be under the misconception that your teams are doing some form of Agile development, when in fact the use of these tools and practices are not only not Agile, but are often producing the opposite effect of what benefits agile develop is intended to provide.

If your developers are working on features in different branches (i.e. not in Main or Master), then you are not practicing continuous integration.

If your developers and workflows are not automated and setup to push code at least daily, then you're not practicing continuous delivery.

How large is your development team? How long does it take your team to develop a new app or website? How long to deliver new features?

My system of [Continuos Agile Software Engineering (CASE) methodologies](https://www.softwarestandards.dev) works with no more than 1-2 developers while enabling them the ability to launch new products that are ready to be targeted to real-world customers within as little as one week, and deliver continuous feature delivery and updates multiple times per day.
